   Let's face it.  At one time or  another, your going to lose files.   Whether
you misplace them in an out of  the way subdirectory, move them to a  different
drive, or archive them.  Well,  don't worry.   Now there's  Quick Find.   Quick
Find was written because, like  everyone,  I  lose  files  all  the  time,  and
although there are a lot of "whereis" programs out there, none cover all of the
aspects of finding files.  THIS ONE  DOES!   Here  are  some  of  Quick  Find's
features:

   1. FAST directory tree searching.
   2. Capability to search every drive on your computer.
   3. Search ONLY the current directory and it's subdirectories for a file.
   4. Capability to search ARC, PAK, DWC, LHARC, PKZIP, ZOO, and LARC type
      archive files.
   5. Global delete function - Delete any unwanted duplicates, anywhere!
   6. Support for MSDOS, OS/2 (text mode), and Windows NT (text mode)

Command Line Usage:
-------------------
   The following command line switches are available with Quick Find:

   /A  - Searches all drives on the system for the file specified.
   /B  - Displays only the filename, no other information is displayed.
   /C  - Starts in the current directory and searches all of it's branches.
   /CF - Searches ARC, PAK, DWC, ZOO, LHARC/LZA, and LARC files.
   /CO - Only displays files within a compressed file.
   /D  - Prompted delete of found files.
   /N  - Turns off delete prompting.  If this switch is not specified along
         with the /D switch, you are prompted every time QF finds a file.
   /P  - Pause mode.  Displays found files a screen at a time.
   /T  - Prints totals by subdirectories, and then an overall total at the
	 end of the search of files and directories found, and total bytes
	 of files found.

   Command line switches can  appear anywhere on the  command line, and can  be
proceeded by either a '/' or '-'  character.  You can also set the  environment
variable QF_OPT to switches you use often, so they do not have to be  specified
upon every invocation of QF.

Release Notes:
--------------

   August 7, 1989

   As of this writing a  file was  being distributed  called LH114.EXE.   Since
this is not an official release from  Yoshi, Quick Find will not support  files
with the .ICE extension.

Registration:
-------------

   If you find QF useful and convienient, and you use it often, you should
register it.  Registration is $10.00 and can be sent to the following
address:

Revision History:
-----------------
   8.00  - Included Windows NT 3.5 (Text Mode) version.
           No Microsoft Windows support will be done until Windows '98 release
            
   7.00  - Included OS/2 2.1 (Text Mode) version.
   
   6.00  - Rewrote command line parser again, and optimized all aspects of the
           code, readying it for a Microsoft Windows port and release.
           This version of Quick Find has been reverted back to the command
           line interface, as this is more convienent, and results in smaller
           code size than the version 5.00 text based window interface release.
           A new DOS window library is in the works, that will give QF total
           CUA compliance.  Until then, the command line, and soon to be
           released Windows version will have to be sufficient.

   5.00  - Added new "Quick Windows" menu interface.  Implemented a few more
           speed optimizations to the code as well.

   4.51  - Fixed LHARC archive searching.  When LZA 2.12 was released, QF had
           trouble reading these files.  QF is now compatible with ALL versions
           of LZA/LHARC versions to this date.  Also changed copyright
           information to 'Quick Solutions', instead of my name.

   4.50  - Re-wrote self verification feature, because old one was WAY too
           slow.  This version should start searching almost immediately.
           Also tried my hand at writing some assembler routines, to cut down
           on the ever enlarging code size (without assembler routines, EXE
           size was around 32.5K).  Didn't achieve a lot of space savings,
           but got some assembler under my belt now (sigh).

   4.01  - Added command line switch to enable redirection.

   4.00  - Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow finding of filenames with a '-'
           character as the FIRST character in the filename.

           Fixed a bug when just QF ? was entered on the command line.  Now
           this will give the same screen as if you had just typed QF<CR>.

           Added /T switch to give subdirectory size and total breaks between
           each directory search.

   3.60  - Implemented a 32-bit CRC self-checking of the QF.EXE file upon
           startup, to insure no tampering has been done to the file.

           Implemented a total re-write of the command line parsing routine,
           to fix a bug in it when there was a '-' or '/' character in the
           file specification.

           Removed DWC, LHARC, LARC and PKZIP self-extracting archive
           searching for the sake of speed.  I did not realize the amount
           of time it added to the compressed file searches when I added
           it, thinking looking in SFX files was worth it.  In my opinion,
           it's not.

   3.51  - Minor bug fixes.

   3.50  - Added DWC, LHARC, LARC and PKZIP self-extracting archive searching.

   3.02  - Added more command line flexibility and the QF_OPT environment
           variable processing to specify default command line switches.

   3.01  - Stripped path from files in LZH files when displaying them.

   3.00  - Added support for LARC version 3.33 and DWC version 4.95 archives.
           Added the /E switch to list archive formats currently supported.

   2.14  - Miscellaneous bug fixes.

   2.13  - Changed compilers from Turbo C 2.00 to Microsoft C 5.1.  This led
           to a substantial improvement in speed.  Also fixed bug when
           searching all drives, would skip the C: drive if floppy B: was
           present.

           Included test results and batch file for comparison of QF to
           Norton's File Find version 4.50.

   2.12  - Added LHARC file support.  Added "Are you sure" prompt and warning
           when using the /D /N switch combination.

   2.11  - Added ZOO file support.  Fixed error checking when searching
           compressed files.  Program would just hang up without telling you
           there was an error.

           Removed the /ARC, /O, /ZIP, and /ZO switches and replaced them with
           /CF and /CO switches, to search ALL compressed files automatically.

   2.10  - Added ZIP file searching and the global delete function.

   2.00  - Added ARC and PAK file searching.

   1.00  - Initial release -- plain "whereis" utility.
