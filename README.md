This is a program that I wrote about 23 years ago and was my first "Shareware" type of program.

The really cool thing about this program is that this was the one I learned C with - and subsequently
learned every other language that I've learned by taking pieces of this one and rewriting it because
I knew it so well.

I hate the bracing style I used in this.   This is probably the 14th reformat overall, and was when I
was in my "Petzold, Programming Windows 3.0" stage.   The bracing style is awful.   I should have 
stuck with K&R style bracing, which is what I do now.

I wound up donating this to the [FreeDOS](http://www.freedos.org) project in July of 2001.   Unfortunately, the only 
record I can find of this now is this [spanish version of the FreeDOS log](http://www.fdos.info/es/Jul2001.htm).

Aside from the bracing style - I hope you enjoy looking at this.   I found it while rummaging through the house
over the last week and thought I would publish it on Github - not because its useful, but because it is historical.

The time this was written was a _great_ time, when someone like me could just start publishing software on bulletin boards.

Trust me, at the time it was cool.

See the [DOCS](docs) directory for some other cool historical documentation, including a software review.
